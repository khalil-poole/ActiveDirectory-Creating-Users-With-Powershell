# ActiveDirectory-Creating-Users-With-Powershell
In this section, we're going to create users with Windows Powershell to setup Group Policy for a fictional organization.

***Environments and Utilities Used***

Microsoft Azure

Virtual Machines

Remote Desktop Connection

Active Directory

Windows Powershell

***Operating Systems Used***

Windows Server

Windows 10

First, turn on the Azure VMs if they are not on already. Then log into client-1 as "mydomain.com\jane_admin".

Right click on the start menu (the bottom left of the screen) and click "System" and then click "Remote Desktop" upon the new pop-up window opening. You may have to maximize the VM window to see it if you haven't done so already.
